## General description

This folder contains the trained Neural Network models with different micromechancial models.

The trained Neural Network are predicting the stress contours with model interpolated on 80-by-80 Cartesian Maps.

To use the trained Neural Network, please use 'tensorflow.keras.models.load_model('model_name'.h5)'
