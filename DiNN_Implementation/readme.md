## General description

This folder contains the files to implement DiNN frameworks, DiNN-N and DiNN-NC, for different micromechanical models.

#### Models using DiNN-N (square-packed and hexagonal-packed): 
 
SP: Square-packed Model
HP: Hexa-packed Model
VR: Volume-Fraction-Random
SR: Spatial-Random
C:  Spatially-Constraint
UC: Spatially-UnConstraint

#### Models using DiNN-NC (plate with circular cutout and hollow particle reinforced):

PC: Plate-with-Cutout Model
HRP: Hollow-Particle-Reinforced Model
