## Implementation
In this repository, DiNN framework is implemented by Tensorflow.
DiNN framwork contains two types of DiNN models: DiNN-N and DiNN-NC. For square and hexagonal packed composites, DiNN-N is used. For plate with circular cutout and hollow particle reinforced composite, DiNN-NC is used.
