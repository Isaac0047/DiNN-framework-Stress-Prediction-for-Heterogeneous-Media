## Implementation
In this repository, DiNN framework is implemented by Tensorflow.
DiNN framwork contains two types of DiNN models: DiNN-N and DiNN-NC. For square and hexagonal packed composites, DiNN-N is used. For plate with circular cutout and hollow particle reinforced composite, DiNN-NC is used. 

## Example instruction
#### Code running with example of plate with circular cutout model
1. go to folder, use code-name to generate
2. go to folder, run ...
